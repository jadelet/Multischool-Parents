# Multischool-Parents--readme version 11.16.18
This site is a means to simplify tracking multiple childrens' schedules that reside on Schoology through a single portal. 

## Summary: 
This project is my final project for fulstack coding bootcamp. I decided to create an application for  modern parents, with kids either in multiple schools within one district, or, like me, kids in multiple schools in multiple districts, (provided, at this time, that those districts use Schoology.) Future hopes are to add addional school planner softwares so that more parents can be served more fully. The application will use yarn as a package manager, and run on React. I intend to include vanilla Javascript and HTML and CSS.
